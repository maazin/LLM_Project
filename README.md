## Project Overview

This project involves:
1. Writing code to assist in LLM output evaluations
2. Running quantized and instruction-tuned Gemma 3 4B using different prompting strategies on the IMDB dataset
3. Comparing LLM results against RNN and baseline models
4. Analyzing and discussing the observed results

## Dataset

The project uses the IMDB Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification:
- 2,000 examples for training
- 100 examples for testing

## Prompting Strategies

The project explores three different prompting approaches:
- Zero-shot prompting
- Few-shot prompting (4 examples - 2 positive, 2 negative)
- Chain-of-thought prompting

## Getting Started

The repository is ready to use. All necessary files have been pulled and are available in the working directory.
